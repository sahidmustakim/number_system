# üî¢ Number System

A professional-grade tool for number system operations with specialized functionality for computer science education and practical applications.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### üåê Main Bases Converter
- **Real-time bidirectional conversion** between binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal
- **Input validation** specific to each base system
- **Interactive results** with detailed conversion steps on click
- **Seamless workflow** - enter in any base, see all representations instantly

### üî¢ General Base Conversion
- **Complete base support** from 2 to 36
- **Transparent conversion process** showing both steps:
  - Source to decimal conversion
  - Decimal to target base conversion
  - Visual representation of the calculation process
- **Comprehensive validation** highlighting invalid digits for selected base

### ‚ûï Arithmetic Calculator
- **Base-specific calculations** for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **Three-step verification** process:
  1. Input conversion to decimal
  2. Operation execution in decimal
  3. Result conversion back to original base
- **Fractional result handling** for division operations
- **Carry/borrow visualization** for addition and subtraction

### üîç Base Finder
- **Complete equation solving** for problems like `(12)r + (13)r = (25)r`
- **Five-step analytical process** matching academic standards:
  1. Convert each term to decimal representation
  2. Set up equation in base 10
  3. Simplify both sides
  4. Solve the equation
  5. Apply base constraints
- **Comprehensive solution analysis** for:
  - Multiple valid bases (r > n)
  - Single valid base solutions
  - No solution cases
- **Verification steps** showing equation validity for each potential base

## üìö Built-in User Manual
